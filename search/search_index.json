Find something wrong? Submit a PR to get it fixed! To make the setup of a Reverse Proxy much easier, Linuxserver.io developed SWAG SWAG - Secure Web Application Gateway (formerly known as letsencrypt, no relation to Let's Encrypt\u2122) sets up an Nginx web server and reverse proxy with PHP support and a built-in certbot client that automates free TLS server certificate generation and renewal processes (Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL). It also contains fail2ban for intrusion prevention. Step 1: Get a domain The first step is to grab a dynamic DNS if you don't have your own subdomain already. You can get this from for example DuckDNS . If you already own a domain, you'll need to create an A record that points to the machine that SWAG is running on. See the SWAG documentation for more details. Step 2: Set-up SWAG Then you will need to set up SWAG, the variables of the docker-compose are explained on the Github page of SWAG . This is an example of how to set it up using DuckDNS and docker-compose. docker-compose.yml version : \"2.1\" services : swag : image : ghcr.io/linuxserver/swag container_name : swag cap_add : - NET_ADMIN environment : - PUID=1000 - PGID=1000 # valid TZs at https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_tz_database_time_zones - TZ=Europe/Brussels - URL=<mydomain.duckdns> - SUBDOMAINS=wildcard - VALIDATION=duckdns - CERTPROVIDER= #optional - DNSPLUGIN= #optional - DUCKDNSTOKEN=<duckdnstoken> - EMAIL=<e-mail> #optional - ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false #optional - EXTRA_DOMAINS=<extradomains> #optional - STAGING=false #optional volumes : - /etc/config/swag:/config ports : - 443:443 # required if VALIDATION=http above, if you aren't using DuckDNS - 80:80 restart : unless-stopped Don't forget to change the mydomain.duckns into your personal domain and the duckdnstoken into your token and remove the brackets. You can also include the contents of the mealie docker-compose in the SWAG docker-compose, without the ports section under mealie. This allows SWAG and mealie to communicate on the same docker network, without making mealie visible to other applications on your machine. Step 3: Change the config files Navigate to the config folder of SWAG and head to proxy-confs . If you used the example above, you should navigate to: /etc/config/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/ . There are a lot of preconfigured files to use for different apps such as radarr, sonarr, overseerr, ... To use the bundled configuration file, simply rename mealie.subdomain.conf.sample in the proxy-confs folder to mealie.subdomain.conf . Alternatively, you can create a new file mealie.subdomain.conf in proxy-confs with the following configuration: mealie.subdomain.conf server { listen 443 ssl http2 ; listen [::]:443 ssl http2 ; server_name mealie.* ; include /config/nginx/ssl.conf ; client_max_body_size 0 ; location / { include /config/nginx/proxy.conf ; include /config/nginx/resolver.conf ; set $upstream_app mealie ; set $upstream_port 80 ; set $upstream_proto http ; proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port ; } } Step 4: Port-forward port 443 Since SWAG allows you to set up a secure connection, you will need to open port 443 on your router for encrypted traffic. This is way more secure than port 80 for http. For more information about using TLS on port 443, see SWAG's documentation on cert providers and port forwarding. Step 5: Restart SWAG When you change anything in the config of Nginx, you will need to restart the container using docker restart swag .

Custom Caddy File The Docker image provided by Mealie contains both the API and the html bundle in one convenient image. This is done by using a proxy server to serve different parts of the application depending on the URL/URI. Requests sent to /api/* or /docs will be directed to the API, anything else will be served the static web files. Below is the default Caddyfile that is used to proxy requests. You can override this file by mounting an alternative Caddyfile to /app/Caddyfile . { auto_https off admin off } :80 { @proxied path /api/* /docs /openapi.json root * /app/dist encode gzip uri strip_suffix / handle_path /api/recipes/image/* { root * /app/data/img/ file_server } handle @proxied { reverse_proxy http://127.0.0.1:9000 } handle { try_files {path}.html {path} / file_server } } Deployed without Docker Unsupported Deployment If you are experiencing a problem with manual deployment, please do not submit a github issue unless it is related to an aspect of the application. For deployment help, the discord server is a better place to find support. Alternatively, this project is built on Python and SQLite so you may run it as a python application on your server. This is not a supported options for deployment and is only here as a reference for those who would like to do this on their own. To get started you can clone this repository into a directory of your choice and use the instructions below as a reference for how to get started. There are three parts to the Mealie application Frontend/Static Files Backend API Proxy Server Frontend/ Static Files The frontend static files are generated with npm run build . This is done during the build process with docker. If you choose to deploy this as a system application you must do this process yourself. In the project directory run cd frontend to change directories into the frontend directory and run npm install and then npm run build . This will generate the static files in a dist folder in the frontend directory. Backend API The backend API is build with Python, FastAPI, and SQLite and requires Python 3.9, and Poetry. Once the requirements are installed, in the project directory you can run the command poetry install to create a python virtual environment and install the python dependencies. Once the dependencies are installed you should be ready to run the server. To initialize that database you need to first run python mealie/db/init_db.py . Then to start The web server, you run the command uvicorn mealie.app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 9000 Proxy Server You must use a proxy server to server up the static files created with npm run build and proxy requests to the API. In the docker build this is done with Caddy. You can use the CaddyFile in the section above as a reference. One important thing to keep in mind is that you should drop any trailing / in the url.

To explore the API spin up your server and navigate to http://yourserver.com/docs for interactive API documentation. Why a Database? Some users of static-site generator applications like ChowDown have expressed concerns about their data being stuck in a database. Considering this is a new project it is a valid concern to be worried about your data. Mealie specifically addresses this concern by provided automatic daily backups that export your data in json, plain-text markdown files, and/or custom Jinja2 templates. This puts you in controls of how your data is represented when exported from Mealie, which means you can easily migrate to any other service provided Mealie doesn't work for you.

Currently this scraper is implemented with recipe-scrapers . You may have mixed results on some websites, especially with blogs or non-specific recipe websites. See the bulk import Option below for another a convenient way to add blog style recipes into Mealie. Tip You can find a list of some of the supported sites in the recipe-scrapers repo. If you're site isn't supported, you can work with the recipe-scrapers team to implement it and we can down-stream those changes into Mealie. Using Bookmarklets You can use bookmarklets to generate a bookmark that will take your current location, and open a new tab that will try to import that URL into Mealie. You can use a bookmarklet generator site and the code below to generate a bookmark for your site. Just change the http://localhost:8080 to your sites web address and follow the instructions. Note that there is no trailing / . var url = document . URL ; var mealie = \"http://localhost:8080\" var dest = mealie + \"/?recipe_import_url=\" + url window . open ( dest , '_blank' ) Recipe Editor Recipes can be edited and created via the UI. This is done with both a form based approach where you have a UI to work with as well as with a in browser JSON Editor. The JSON editor allows you to easily copy and paste data from other sources.
