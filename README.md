# About The Project

Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend application built in Vue for a pleasant user experience for the whole family. Easily add recipes into your database by providing the URL and Mealie will automatically import the relevant data, or add a family recipe with the UI editor. Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications.

<!-- CONTRIBUTING -->
## Contributing

Contributions are what make the open source community such an amazing place to learn, inspire, and create. Any contributions you make are **greatly appreciated**. If you're going to be working on the code-base, you'll want to use the nightly documentation to ensure you get the latest information.

- See the [Contributors Guide](https://nightly.mealie.io/contributors/developers-guide/code-contributions/) for help getting started.
- We use [VSCode Dev Containers](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/remote/containers) to make it easy for contributors to get started!

If you are not a coder, you can still contribute financially. Financial contributions help me prioritize working on this project over others and helps me know that there is a real demand for project development.
