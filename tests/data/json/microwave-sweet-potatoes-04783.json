    "description": "Microwave jacket sweet potatoes make a wonderfully quick and easy meal. Take your pick of these three delicious fillings, or make all of them! The veggie chilli makes enough for four portions, great for lunch tomorrow. The smoked mackerel and pea fillings each make enough for two portions. \r\n\r\nThis recipe was tested using a 900W microwave oven. If your oven has more or fewer watts, you will need to adjust the cooking time.\r\n",
