We love how the spicy Moroccan flavors on the steak complement the sweet, roasted pepper-studded couscous. Serve with: Arugula salad and a glass of Pinot Noir.",

The seasoning had a tasty and light flavor. I used sirloin because the skirt steak at the store looked very fatty. The couscous (although I didn't add the olives because I'm not a huge fan) was also very good and I enjoyed the sweetness of the bell pepper. I used the lemon garnish to squeeze over the couscous and meat and think it made it. I would definitely make this again! Pros: Tasty and easy weeknight meal",
