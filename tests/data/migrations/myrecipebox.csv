Apple Strudel,This vegan apple strudel is made with a gooey cinnamon-apple filling nestled inside a flaky puff pastry braid. It's surprisingly easy to make and absolutely delicious!,20,40,,60,,"3 cups thinly sliced and peeled apples ((about 2 large or 3 medium apples, weighing about 1 pound))
1/4 cup organic granulated sugar, (plus more for sprinkling on top of the strudel)
1/4 cup raisins
1/4 cup slivered almonds
1 1/2 tablespoons rum
2 teaspoons lemon juice
2 tablespoons all-purpose flour
1 teaspoon vanilla extract
1 teaspoon ground cinnamon
1/4 teaspoon salt
1 sheet (about 8 ounces or 250 grams) vegan puff pastry, (thawed)
2 tablespoons non-dairy milk
Organic powdered sugar, (for topping, optional)","Preheat the oven to 400°F.

In a large mixing bowl, stir together the apples, sugar, raisins, almonds, rum, lemon juice, flour, vanilla, cinnamon and salt.

Place the puff pastry sheet onto a lightly floured piece of parchment paper and use a lightly floured rolling pin to roll it to a 12 x 14 inch rectangle.

Use a knife to cut approximately 1-inch strips down either (long) side of the rectangle, cutting the strips about a third of the way into the width of the rectangle (you can see a photo of this within the post above).

Spoon the filling down the center of the rectangle, leaving about 1 to 2 inches at the top and bottom ends.

Starting at the bottom, fold the strips inward at a slight diagonal, over the filling, pinching opposite strips together.

Brush the pastry with milk, then sprinkle it lightly with sugar.

Carefully transfer the parchment paper to a baking sheet.

Bake the strudel until the pastry is golden brown and the filling is bubbly inside, about 35 to 40 minutes.

Place the baking sheet on a cooling rack and let the strudel cool for a few minutes.

Optionally, sprinkle the strudel with powdered sugar.

Slice the strudel with a serrated knife and serve warm.",,"servingSize : 1 slice (1/6 of recipe)

1 Tablespoon corn syrup
½ teaspoon cinnamon
2 Tablespoons honey
½ cup powdered sugar
½ teaspoon lemon juice
½-1 Tablespoon warm water","Preheat oven to 350°.

Combine cookie ingredients in large bowl and mix until completely incorporated.  NOTE:  Dough will be thick.

Using a medium sized cookie scoop {or heaping tablespoon}, scoop cookie dough onto a silicone mat {or parchment} lined cookie sheet.

Bake for 9 minutes and remove from oven and remove. Once the cookies are partially baked, use the bottom of the same cookie scoop {or a tart shaper} and make an indention into the middle of each cookie, being careful not to press too hard {you don't want the scoop to press entirely through the cookie}.

Fill the indentation with baklava filling. Bake for an additional 2-3 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow the cookies to cool on the baking sheet.

Once the cookies are cool or almost cooled combine the honey glaze ingredients and. whisk until you have a nice glaze.

Balsamic Mushroom Wild Rice Soup,"One pot, very few ingredients, this vegan wild rice soup is so creamy, hearty and incredibly delicious!",5,40,,45,,"1 Tablespoon Olive oil
14 Ounces Mushrooms, sliced, I used shiitakes and baby bellas
6 Cloves Garlic, chopped
2 Teaspoons Balsamic vinegar
3 Tablespoons Vegan butter, I used Earth Balance
3 Tablespoons All purpose flour
5 Cups Vegetable broth
3 Cups Non dairy milk, I used Almond milk
1/2 Cup Wild rice
1/2 Cup White or brown rice
3 Sprigs Fresh Thyme
2 Teaspoons Fresh Rosemary
Salt and pepper to taste
Fresh lemons to squeeze on top(optional)","In a large soup pot, heat the olive oil on medium high. Then add the sliced mushrooms and chopped garlic. Saute reducing heat as needed until the mushrooms release their liquid and begin to brown. This may take about 5 minutes or so. Season with a pinch of salt and pepper. 

Then pour the balsamic vinegar on to the mushrooms and saute for another minute until they are nice and brown and juicy. Remove them from the pot and set aside. 

Next, add the vegan butter to the soup pot and melt it. Then stir the flour into the melted vegan butter and stir into a paste to make a roux. 

Now, add the vegetable broth and the non dairy milk to the pot. Whisk to incorporate the roux(flour and butter) into the liquid. Season with a  few pinches of salt and pepper. 

Bring to a boil, then add the wild rice and then the white or brown rice. Check packages for time instructions. Sometimes I add my wild rice a few minutes before the other rice because it takes longer, but check your package. Reduce heat to a simmer. 

Then add the thyme and rosemary. Stir to combine everything. 

Simmer on medium low for about 25-30 minutes or until the rice is cooked through. 

Now, add the balsamic mushrooms back into the pot and stir to combine. 

Taste and adjust seasoning. Add a little more salt and pepper and a squeeze of lemon if desired! Serve immediately. It will thicken up a great deal if you let it sit around because the rice will keep absorbing the liquid and get mushy.",,,false,,The main course,,,https://www.rabbitandwolves.com/vegan-creamy-balsamic-mushroom-wild-rice-soup/,https://www.rabbitandwolves.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Vegan-Creamy-Wild-Rice-Soup0503-480x270.jpg,

Banh Mi Sandwich,"This yummy banh mi recipe is a vegetarian version of the popular Vietnamese sandwich. I stuff it with seared tofu, pickled carrots and daikon, cucumbers, jalapeños, and more!",20,20,,40,,"INGREDIENTS:
1 (14-ounce) package extra firm tofu (see notes)
extra-virgin olive oil (for the pan)
4 baguette pieces (sliced in half)
A few sprigs of cilantro per sandwich
Sriracha
Pickled Asian Veggies
Spicy Mayo (Mayo- 1/4 c, Hoisin- 3tbs, Sriracha- 1tsp)

TOFU MARINADE:
1 tablespoon olive oil
2 tablespoons tamari
Juice of 1/2 lime + a little zest
1 garlic clove (minced)
1/2 teaspoon minced ginger
Freshly ground black pepper

","Make ahead: 1. Asian pickles (2 days min), 2. Spicy Mayo (1day) 

Drain the tofu and slice it into 1/2-inch slices. Place it on a towel and gently pat dry to remove excess water.

In a small bowl, whisk together the olive oil, tamari, lime juice and zest, garlic, ginger, and pepper.

Place the tofu in a shallow pan and pour the marinade on top. Flip the tofu to fully coat it, adding more tamari if necessary. Let the tofu marinate for at least 15 minutes.

Heat a nonstick skillet to medium-high heat. Add a little oil to the pan and place the tofu pieces with enough space between each so that they’re not too crowded, working in batches if necessary. Without moving the tofu slices around too much, let them cook for a few minutes per side until they’re deeply golden brown and caramelized around the edges. Remove from heat and season to taste. You may also air fry it at 350 for 15 mins.

Assemble sandwiches with the baguette, mayo, tofu slices, pickled veggies, and cilantro, and serve with sriracha.",,,false,,The main course;Vietnames,,,https://www.loveandlemons.com/banh-mi/,https://cdn.loveandlemons.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/banh-mi.jpg,
Beef & Cheese Piroshki ,Learn how to make traditional Russian piroshki with a juicy and flavorful beef and cheese filling!,90,25,,115,,"1 1/2 cups milk
1 tablespoon dry yeast
1/2 tablespoon sugar
1 teaspoon salt
3 tablespoons melted butter
1 egg
3 1/2 cups all-purpose flour (plus extra for rolling/shaping)
2 pound ground beef 
1 large onion
3 garlic cloves
1 large egg
1 pkg mozzarella cheese
1 pkg cheddar cheese
1 1/2 teaspoons salt
1/2 teaspoon ground black pepper
1 pkg fresh chopped dill
6 cups cooking oil (for fried piroshki)","Prepare the yeast dough first. Heat the milk until warm to touch, then pour into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and sprinkle the yeast evenly over the milk. Allow the yeast to proof for 5 minutes. After 5 minutes, whisk in the melted butter, salt and egg. Gradually add the flour, whisking the mixture until it thickens into a thick batter. Continue adding flour until soft dough forms.

Turn dough out onto well-floured work surface; use additional flour as needed. Knead the dough for 4 to 5 minutes until smooth and elastic. Return the dough to mixing bowl, cover the bowl with a clean towel and allow the dough to proof until doubled in size; about 45 to 60 minutes.

Meanwhile, prepare the filling. Preheat a large frying over medium-high heat, add a splash of oil and fry the ground beef for 7 to 8 minutes, breaking it up into small pieces. Let the meat cool until just warm. Place the onion and garlic into a food processor and pulse into a puree. Alternatively, use a grater to puree the onion and finely mince the garlic. In a large bowl combine all of the filling ingredients: fried beef, pureed onion, garlic, cheeses, egg and seasonings. Use your hands to knead the ingredients together to form a uniform mixture.

Once dough has proof, punch it down and knead again for a few minutes. Divide the dough into even portions - 8 pieces for large piroshki, 16 pieces for smaller piroshki. Roll each piece of dough into a circle, add filling into the center, then press the dough together to seal the filling inside (watch my video to see how it's done!).

Deep Fried: preheat approximately 6 cups of vegetable or canola oil in a large pot over medium-high heat, until the oil temperature reads 325F/162C. Shape 3 to 4 piroshki at a time; DO NOT allow them to proof! Add the shaped piroshki straight into the hot oil, seam side down first. Turn the piroshki often, frying for 5 to 6 minutes, until they're a rich, golden brown color.

Baked: Place piroshki seam side up onto baking sheets lined with parchment paper. Brush the tops with an egg wash using a pastry brush. Allow the piroshki to proof for 30 to 45 minutes. Meanwhile, preheat oven to 350F. Once the piroshki have proofed, bake them for 25 to 30 minutes, depending on the size of your piroshki. Remove from baking sheet onto a cooling rack to cool for 15 to 20 minutes before enjoying. The filling will be extremely hot when the piroshki come out of the oven! Allow them to cool before enjoy.",,"calories : 334 kcal
