Tasks Package

Common recurring tasks for the server to perform. Tasks here are registered to the SchedulerRegistry class
in the app.py file as a post-startup task. This is done to ensure that the tasks are run after the server has
started up and the Scheduler object is only avaiable to a single worker.
