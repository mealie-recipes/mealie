# Meal Planner

## Working with Meal Plans
In Mealie you can create a meal plan based off the calendar inputs on the meal planner page. There is no limit to how long or how short a meal plan is. You may also create duplicate meal plans for the same date range. After selecting your date range, click on the card for each day and search through recipes to find your choice. After selecting a recipe for all meals save the plan. You can also randomly generate meal plans.

To edit the meal in a meal plan simply select the edit button on the card in the timeline. Similarly, to delete a meal plan click the delete button on the card in the timeline. Currently there is no support to change the date range in a meal plan.


## Shopping Lists
For any meal plan created you can view a breakdown of all the ingredients and use an experimental sort function to sort similarly ingredients. This is a very new feature and results of the auto sort may vary.
