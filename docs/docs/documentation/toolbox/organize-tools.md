#Toolbox
The toolbox gives you multiple options to clean-up and organize your recipes. You can get notified through different channels.
You can access it through the 'Settings' menu or through the [dashboard](../admin/dashboard.md).


## Category and Tag Editor

The 'Categories' and 'Tags' tab give you the option to bulk assign categories and tags to multiple recipes. You could also remove the unused ones or title case them all.
