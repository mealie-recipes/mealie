# About The Project

!!! warning "Mealie v1 Beta Release"
    This documentation is for the Mealie v1 Beta release and is not final. As such, it may contain incomplete or incorrect information. You should understand that installing Mealie v1 Beta is a work in progress and while we've committed to maintaining the database schema and provided migrations, we are still in the process of adding new features, and robust testing to ensure the application works as expected.

    You should likely find bugs, errors, and unfinished pages within the application. To find the current status of the release you can checkout the [project on github](https://github.com/hay-kot/mealie/projects/7) or reach out on discord.


Mealie is a self hosted recipe manager and meal planner with a RestAPI backend and a reactive frontend application built in Vue for a pleasant user experience for the whole family. Easily add recipes into your database by providing the url and Mealie will automatically import the relevant data or add a family recipe with the UI editor. Mealie also provides an API for interactions from 3rd party applications.

## FAQ

### Why An API?
An API allows integration into applications like [Home Assistant](https://www.home-assistant.io/) that can act as notification engines to provide custom notifications based of Meal Plan data to remind you to defrost the chicken, marinade the steak, or start the CrockPot. Additionally, you can access nearly any backend service via the API giving you total control to extend the application. To explore the API spin up your server and navigate to http://yourserver.com/docs for interactive API documentation.

### Why a Database?
Some users of static-site generator applications like ChowDown have expressed concerns about their data being stuck in a database. Considering this is a new project it is a valid concern to be worried about your data. Mealie specifically addresses this concern by provided automatic daily backups that export your data in json, plain-text markdown files, and/or custom Jinja2 templates. **This puts you in controls of how your data is represented** when exported from Mealie, which means you can easily migrate to any other service provided Mealie doesn't work for you.

As to why we need a database?

- **Developer Experience:** Without a database a lot of the work to maintain your data is taken on by the developer instead of a battle tested platform for storing data.
- **Multi User Support:** With a solid database as backend storage for your data Mealie can better support multi-user sites and avoid read/write access errors when multiple actions are taken at the same time.
