## Recipes

### Creating Recipes

Mealie offers two main ways to create recipes. You can use the integrated recipe-scraper to create recipes from hundreds of websites, or you can create recipes manually using the recipe editor.

### Importing Recipes

Mealie supports importing recipes from a few other sources besides websites. Currently the following sources are supported:

- Mealie Pre v1
- Nextcloud Cookbooks
- Paprika
- Chowdown

You can access these options on your installation at the `/group/migrations` page on your installation. If you'd like to see another source added, feel free to request so on Github.

### Organizing Recipes

Mealie has a few ways to organize recipes you create.

#### Categories


Categories are the overarching organizer for recipes. You can assign as many categories as you'd like to a recipe, but we recommend that you try to limit the categories you assign to a recipe to one or two. This helps keep categories as broad as possible while still allowing you to find recipes that are related to each other. For example, you might assign a recipe to the category `Breakfast`, `Lunch`, `Dinner`, or `Side`.

#### Tags

Tags, are nearly identical to categories in function but play a secondary role in some cases. As such, we recommend that you use tags freely to help you organize your recipes by more specific topics. For example, if a recipe can be frozen or is a great left-over meal, you could assign the tags `frozen` and `left-over` and easily filter for those at a later time.

#### Tools

Tools, are another way that some users like to organize their recipes. If a recipe requires some specific equipment if can be helpful to assign the tools to the recipes. This is particularly useful for things that are less common, like a pressure cooker, or a sous vide.

Each of the above organizers can be filtered in searches, and have their own pages where you can view all the recipes that are associated with those organizers.

#### Cookbooks

Mealie also has the concept of cookbooks. These can be created inside of a group and can use a cross section of Categories, Tags, and Tools to filter recipes and view them in one specific page. Cookbooks are a great way to keep a supset of recipes easily accessible to you. You can think of them as a saved search results page. While most examples are simple, you can use as many organizers to filter a cookbook as you'd like.

#### Examples:

- Main Courses: This cookbooks has all the recipes that have the `Dinner` category
- Pasta Sides: Recipes that have both the `Side` category and the `Pasta` tag
- Dessert Breads: Recipes that have both the `Bread` category and the `Dessert` tag

## Meal Planning

Mealie uses a calendar like view to help you plan your meals. It shows you the previous day, and the next 6 days by default. You can toggle through the calendar by clicking the arrows on the top of the page. In editor mode, you can use the random recipe buttons, or manually add an entry. You can also add a "Note" type entry to your meal-plan when you want to include something that might not have a specific recipes. This is great for leftovers, or for ordering out.

### Planner Rules

You can create rules for auto selecting recipes for you meal plans. These rules are used by the server to determine the random pool of recipes to select from when creating meal plans.
