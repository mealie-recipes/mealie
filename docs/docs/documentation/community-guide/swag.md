To make the setup of a Reverse Proxy much easier, Linuxserver.io developed [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag)  
SWAG - Secure Web Application Gateway (formerly known as letsencrypt, no relation to Let's Encryptâ„¢) sets up an Nginx web server and reverse proxy with PHP support and a built-in certbot client that automates free SSL server certificate generation and renewal processes (Let's Encrypt and ZeroSSL). It also contains fail2ban for intrusion prevention.

## Step 1: Get a domain

The first step is to grab a dynamic DNS if you don't have your own subdomain already. You can get this from for example [DuckDNS](https://www.duckdns.org).

## Step 2: Set-up SWAG

Then you will need to set up SWAG, the variables of the docker-compose are explained on the Github page of [SWAG](https://github.com/linuxserver/docker-swag).
This is an example of how to set it up using duckdns and docker-compose.

!!! example "docker-compose.yml"
```yaml
version: "3.1"
services:
swag:
image: ghcr.io/linuxserver/swag
container_name: swag
cap_add:
- NET_ADMIN
environment:
- PUID=1000
- PGID=1000
- TZ=Europe/Brussels
- URL=<mydomain.duckdns>
- SUBDOMAINS=wildcard
- VALIDATION=duckdns
- CERTPROVIDER= #optional
- DNSPLUGIN= #optional
- DUCKDNSTOKEN=<duckdnstoken>
- EMAIL=<e-mail> #optional
- ONLY_SUBDOMAINS=false #optional
- EXTRA_DOMAINS=<extradomains> #optional
- STAGING=false #optional
volumes:
- /etc/config/swag:/config
ports:
- 443:443
- 80:80 #optional
restart: unless-stopped

```

Don't forget to change the <code>mydomain.duckns</code> into your personal domain and the <code>duckdnstoken</code> into your token and remove the brackets.

## Step 3: Change the config files

Navigate to the config folder of SWAG and head to <code>proxy-confs</code>. If you used the example above, you should navigate to: <code>/etc/config/swag/nginx/proxy-confs/</code>.
There are a lot of preconfigured files to use for different apps such as radarr, sonarr, overseerr, ...

To use the bundled configuration file, simply rename <code>mealie.subdomain.conf.sample</code> in the proxy-confs folder to <code>mealie.subdomain.conf</code>. Currently, you will have to change the $upstream_app and $upstream_port to mealie-frontend and port 3000. This will be added to the bundled config files once the beta is released.
Alternatively, you can create a new file <code>mealie.subdomain.conf</code> in proxy-confs with the following configuration:

!!! example "mealie.subdomain.conf"
```yaml
    server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    listen [::]:443 ssl http2;

    	server_name mealie.*;

    	include /config/nginx/ssl.conf;

    	client_max_body_size 0;

    	location / {
        	include /config/nginx/proxy.conf;
        	include /config/nginx/resolver.conf;
        	set $upstream_app mealie-frontend;
        	set $upstream_port 3000;
        	set $upstream_proto http;
        	proxy_pass $upstream_proto://$upstream_app:$upstream_port;
    		}

	}	
```

## Step 4: Port-forward port 443

Since SWAG allows you to set up a secure connection, you will need to open port 443 on your router for encrypted traffic. Port 80 can be used as well if you want to have the http to https redirect working. This is however optional and not recommended, only if you have a specific usage for it.

## Step 5: Restart SWAG

When you change anything in the config of Nginx, you will need to restart the container using <code>docker restart swag</code>.
If everything went well, you can now access mealie on the subdomain you configured: mealie.mydomain.duckdns.org
