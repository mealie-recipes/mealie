**App Version: v0.5.0**

**Database Version: v0.5.0**

## Breaking Changes

!!! error "Breaking Changes"

    #### Database
    Database version has been bumped from v0.4.x -> v0.5.0. You will need to export and import your data. Moving forward, we will be using database migrations (BETA) to do this automatically. Note that you still must backup your data. If you don't, it's entirely possible something may go wrong and you could lose your data on upgrade. 

    #### Image Directory
    the /data/img directory has been depreciated. All images are now stored in the /recipes/{slug}/image directory. Images should be migrated automatically, but you may experience issues related to this change. 

    #### API Usage
    If you have been using the API directly, many of the routes and status codes have changed. You may experience issues with directly consuming the API.
