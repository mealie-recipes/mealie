# v0.5.0 Too Many Changes! 

**App Version: v0.5.0**

**Database Version: v0.5.0**

## Breaking Changes

!!! error "Breaking Changes"

    #### Database
    Database version has been bumped from v0.4.x -> v0.5.0. You will need to export and import your data. Moving forward, we will be using database migrations (BETA) to do this automatically. Note that you still must backup your data. If you don't, it's entirely possible something may go wrong and you could lose your data on upgrade. 

    #### Image Directory
    the /data/img directory has been depreciated. All images are now stored in the /recipes/{slug}/image directory. Images should be migrated automatically, but you may experience issues related to this change. 

    #### API Usage
    If you have been using the API directly, many of the routes and status codes have changed. You may experience issues with directly consuming the API.

    #### Arm/v7 Support
    Mealie will no longer build in CI/CD due to a issue with the rust compiler on 32 bit devices. You can reference [this issue on the matrix-org/synapse](https://github.com/matrix-org/synapse/issues/9403) Github page that are facing a similar issue. You may still be able to build the docker image you-self. 

!!! warning "Potential Data Loss"
    With this release comes a major rework of how files are stored on disk and where things belong. Migration of files should be done automatically. We have tested extensively with many different backups and user bases and have found that no one experienced data-loss. HOWEVER, with all the major changes that have occurred, it is vital that to prevent any data-loss you must create a backup and store that backup outside of your mealie instance. If you do not do this, you may lose your data.
