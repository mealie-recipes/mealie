### Docker 

#### Huge thanks to [@wengtad](https://github.com/wengtad) for all his work on improving the deployment with docker. 

  - Optimize Docker Dev Size (Frontend: from ~1.52GB to ~429MB | API: from ~657MB to ~380MB)
  - Optimize Docker Prod Size (from ~542MB to ~373MB)
  - Add Gunicorn
  - Add Gunicorn and Webworkers to Dockerfile #550
  - Add Docs for Gunicorn
  - Add PUID/PGID to Docker. Fixes Initialization scripts fail to run when not executing as root user inside container #350,
  - Not able to run correctly in docker if user permissions are specified #429
  - Merge Dockerfile.dev into Dockerfile (dev shared same base together with prod)
  - Add Docs for PUID/PGID
  - Add Docker healthcheck (for this is not necessary, I could remove if you want)
