# v0.4.0 Whoa, What a Release!

**App Version: v0.4.0**

**Database Version: v0.4.0**

## Breaking Changes

!!! error "Breaking Changes"

    #### Database
    A new database will be created. You must export your data and then import it after upgrading.

    #### Site Settings
    With the addition of group settings and a re-write of the database layer of the application backend, there is no migration path for your current site settings. Webhooks Settings, Meal Plan Categories are now managed by groups. Site settings, mainly homepage settings, are now site specific and managed by administrators. When upgrading be sure to uncheck the settings when importing your old data.

    #### ENV Variables
    Names have been changed to be more consistent with industry standards. See the [Installation Page](/mealie/getting-started/install/) for new parameters.

    - Everything!
  - The API Reference is now better embedded inside of the docs
  - New default external port in documentation (Port 9000 -> 9925). This is only the port exposed by the host to the docker image. It doesn't change any existing functionality.

### User Authentication
  - Authentication! Tons of stuff went into creating a flexible authentication platform for a lot of different use cases. Review the documentation for more information on how to use the authentication, and how everything works together. More complex management of recipes and user restrictions are in the works, but this is a great start! Some key features include
    - Sign Up Links
    - Admin and User Roles
    - Password Change
    - Group Management
    - Create/Edit/Delete Restrictions

### Custom Pages
  - You can now create custom pages that are displayed on the homepage sidebar to organize categories of recipes into pages. For example, if you have several categories that encompass "Entrée" you can group all those categories together under the "Entrée" page. See [Building Pages](/mealie/site-administration/building-pages/) for more information.
!!! tip
    Note that this replaces the behavior of automatically adding categories to the sidebar.
