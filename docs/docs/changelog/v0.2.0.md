# v0.2.0 - Now with Test!
This is, what I think, is a big release! Tons of new features and some great quality of life improvements with some additional features. You may find that I made promises to include some fixes/features in v0.2.0. The short of is I greatly underestimated the work needed to refactor the database to a usable state and integrate categories in a way that is useful for users. This shouldn't be taken as a sign that I'm dropping those feature requests or ignoring them. I felt it was better to push a release in the current state rather than drag on development to try and fulfil all of the promises I made. 

!!! warning "Upgrade Process"
    Database Breaks! I have not yet implemented a database migration service. As such, upgrades cannot be done by simply pulling the image. You must first export your recipes, update your deployment, and then import your recipes. This pattern is likely to be how upgrades take place prior to v1.0. After v1.0 migrations will be done automatically.

  - Remove ability to save recipe with no name
  - Fixed data validation error on missing parameters
  - Fixed failed database initialization at startup - Closes #98
  - Fixed misaligned text on various cards
  - Fixed bug that blocked opening links in new tabs - Closes #122
