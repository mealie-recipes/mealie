# v1.0.0 A Whole New App!

# DRAFT

!!! error "Breaking Changes"
    As you may have guessed, this release comes with some breaking changes. If you are/were consuming the API you will need to validate all endpoints as nearly all of them have changed. 

    To import your data into Mealie v1 from the most recent previous release, you'll need to export and import your data using the built in method. **Note that only your recipes will be usable in the migration**.


## ‚ú® What's New (What isn't?!?!)

### ü•≥ General
- Mealie will by default only be accessible to users. Future plans are to create spaces for non-users to access a specific group.
- Mealie has gone through a big redesign and has tried to standardize it's look a feel a bit more across the board.
- User/Group settings are now completely separated from the Administration page.
- All settings and configurations pages now have some sort of self-documenting help text. Additional text or descriptions are welcome from PRs


**Site Settings Page**
- Site Settings has been completely revamped. All site-wide settings at defined on the server as ENV variables. The site settings page now only shows you the non-secret values for reference. It also has some helpers to let you know if something isn't configured correctly. 
    - Server Side Bare URL will let you know if the BASE_URL env variable has been set
    - Secure Site let's you know if you're serving via HTTPS or accessing by localhost. accessing without a secure site will render some of the features unusable. 
    - Email Configuration Status will let you know if all the email settings have been provided and offer a way to send test emails.


### üë®‚Äçüë©‚Äçüëß‚Äçüë¶ Users and Groups
- All members of a group can generate invitation tokens for other users to join their group
- Users now a have "Advanced" setting to enable/disable features like Webhooks and API tokens. This will also apply to future features that are deemed as advanced.
- "Pages" have been dropped in favor of Cookbooks which are now group specific so each group can have it's own set of cookbooks
- Default recipe settings can now be set by the group instead of environmental variables.
- Password reset via email
- Invitation to group by email
- Manage group member permissions

### üóì Meal Plans
- Meal plans have been completely redesigned to use a calendar approach so you'll be able to see what meals you have planned in a more traditional view
- Drag and Drop meals between days
- Add Recipes or Notes to a specific day

### ü•ô Recipes

**Recipe General**
- Recipes are now only viewable by group members
- You can now import multiple URLs at a time pre-tagged using the bulk importer. This task runs in the background so no need to wait for it to finish. 
- Foods/Units for Ingredients are now supported (toggle inside your recipe settings)
- Common Food and Units come pre-packaged with Mealie
- Landscape and Portrait views is now available
- Users with the advanced flag turned on will not be able to manage recipe data in bulk and perform the following actions:
    - Set Categories
    - Set Tags
    - Delete Recipes
    - Export Recipes
- Recipes now have a `/cook` page for a simple view of the recipe where you can click through each step of a recipe and it's associated ingredients.
- The Bulk Importer has received many additional upgrades.
  - Trim Whitespace: automatically removes leading and trailing whitespace
  - Trim Prefix: Removes the first character of each line. Useful for when you paste in a list of ingredients or instructions that have 1. or 2. in front of them.
  - Split By Numbered Line: Attempts to split a paragraph into multiple lines based on the patterns matching '1.', '1:' or '1)'.

**Recipe Ingredients**
- Recipe ingredients can now be scaled when the food/unit is defined
- Recipe ingredients can no be copied as markdown lists
  - example `- [ ] 1 cup of flour`
- You can no use Natural Language Processing (NLP) to process ingredients and attempt to parse them into amounts, units, and foods. There additional is a "Brute Force" processor that can be used to use a pattern matching parser to try and determine ingredients. **Note** if you are processing a Non-English language you will have terrible results with the NLP and will likely need to use the Bruce Force processor.

**Recipe Instructions**
- Can now be merged with the above step automatically through the action menu
- Recipe Ingredients can be linked directly to recipe instructions for improved display
  - There is an option in the linking dialog to automatically link ingredients. This works by using a key-word matching algorithm to find the ingredients. It's not perfect so you'll need to verify the links after use, additionally you will find that it doesn't work for non-english languages.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Other things to know...
- Themes have been depreciated for specific users. You can still set specific themes for your site through ENV variables. This approach should yield much better results for performance and some weirdness users have experienced.
- If you've experienced slowness in the past, you may notice a significant improvement in the "All Recipes" and "Search" pages, or wherever large payloads of recipes are being displayed. This is due to not validating responses from the database, as such if you are consuming these API's you may get extra values that are unexpected.


### üë®‚Äçüíª Backend/Development Goodies
- Codebase is significantly more organized both Frontend and Backend
- We've moved to Nuxt for SSR and Typescript for better type safety and less bugs üéâ
- Backend now using a Class based architecture to maximize code reuse
- Tons of performance improvements across the board
