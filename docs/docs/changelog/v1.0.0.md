# v1.0.0 A Whole New App!

# DRAFT

!!! error "Breaking Changes"
    As you may have guessed, this release comes with some breaking changes. If you are/were consuming the API you will need to validate all endpoints as nearly all of them have changed. 

    To import your data into Mealie v1 from the most recent previous release, you'll need to export and import your data using the bult in method. **Note that only your recipes will be usable in the migration**.


## ✨ What's New (What isn't?!?!)

### 🥳 General
- Mealie will by default only be accessible to users. Future plans are to create spaces for non-users to access a specific group.
- Mealie has gone through a big redesign and has tried to standerize it's look a feel a bit more across the board.
- User/Group settings are now completly seperated from the Administration page.
- All settings and configurations pages now have some sort of self-documenting help text. Additional text or descriptions are welcome from PRs

### 👨‍👩‍👧‍👦 Users and Groups
- Recipes are now only viewable by group members
- All memebers of a group can generate invitation tokens for other users to join their group
- Users now a have "Advaced" setting to enable/disable features like Webhooks and API tokens. This will also apply to future features that are deemed as advanced.
- "Pages" have been dropped in favor of Cookbooks which are now group specific so each group can have it's own set of cookbooks
- Default recipe settings can now be set by the group instead of environmental variables.


### 🗓 Meal Plans
- Mealplans have been completly redesigned to use a calendar approach so you'll be able to see what meals you have planned in a more traditional view
- Drag and Drop meals between days
- Add Recipes or Notes to a specific day

### 🥙 Recipes
- Foods/Units for Ingredients are now supported (toggle inside your recipe settings)
- Common Food and Units come pre-packaged with Mealie
- Recipes can now scale when Food/Units are properly defined
- Landscape and Portrait views is now available

### ⚠️ Other things to know...
- Themes have been depreciated for specific users. You can still set specific themes for your site through ENV variables. This approach should yield much better results for perforance and some weirdness users have experienced.
- If you've experienced slowness in the past, you may notice a significant improvement in the "All Recipes" and "Search" pages, or whereever large payloads of recipes are being displayed. This is due to not validating responses from the database, as such if you are consuming these API's you may get extra values that are unexpected.


### 👨‍💻 Backend/Development Goodies
- Codebase is siginficantly more organized both Frontend and Backend
- We've moved to Nuxt for SSR and Typescript for better type safety and less bugs 🎉
- Backend now using a Class based architecture to maxamize code reuse
- Tons of performance improvements across the board
