!!! error "Breaking Changes"
    As I've adopted the SQL database model I find that using 2 different types of databases will inevitably hinder development. As such after release v0.1.0 support for mongoDB will no longer be available. Prior to upgrading to v0.2.0 you will need to export your site and import after updating. This should be a painless process and require minimal intervention on the users part. Moving forward we will do our best to minimize changes that require user intervention like this and make updates a smooth process.
