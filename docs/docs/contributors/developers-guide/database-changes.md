# Development: Database Changes

This document is open to improvement; please share any insights you have/develop.

## Overview

When modifying the database, you will most likely need to change the files under `/mealie/db/models/`.
How exactly you need to modify it is of course highly contextual to the change you're making.

## Using Alembic to generate upgrade script

In your dev container you can run something like (change the message) `alembic revision --autogenerate -m "Add creation tag to group preferences"` to have Alembic generate an upgrade script for you.

The script Alembic generates, will be limited! (Perhaps there's a way to resolve that? Haven't looked into it yet)
For example, Alembic generated a script _similar_ to this (it has been modified already to have accurate foreign key names, for instance):

```Python
"""Add creation tag to group preferences

Revision ID: 0ea6eb8eaa44
Revises: ba1e4a6cfe99
Create Date: 2024-01-04 12:40:03.062671

"""
import sqlalchemy as sa

import mealie.db.migration_types
from alembic import op

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = "0ea6eb8eaa44"
down_revision = "ba1e4a6cfe99"
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None


def upgrade():
    ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.add_column(
        "group_preferences", sa.Column("recipe_creation_tag", mealie.db.migration_types.GUID(), nullable=True)
    )
    op.create_foreign_key("fk_groupprefs_tags", "group_preferences", "tags", ["recipe_creation_tag"], ["id"])
    ### end Alembic commands ###


def downgrade():
    ### commands auto generated by Alembic - please adjust! ###
    op.drop_constraint("fk_groupprefs_tags", "group_preferences", type_="foreignkey")
    op.drop_column("group_preferences", "recipe_creation_tag")
    ### end Alembic commands ###
```

But when trying to actually use that upgrade script, it becomes clear that our SQLite database doesn't like them. The minor modification needed looks like:

```Python
"""Add creation tag to group preferences

Revision ID: 0ea6eb8eaa44
Revises: ba1e4a6cfe99
Create Date: 2024-01-04 12:40:03.062671

"""
import sqlalchemy as sa

import mealie.db.migration_types
from alembic import op

# revision identifiers, used by Alembic.
revision = "0ea6eb8eaa44"
down_revision = "ba1e4a6cfe99"
branch_labels = None
depends_on = None


def upgrade():
    with op.batch_alter_table("group_preferences", schema=None) as batch_op:
        batch_op.add_column(sa.Column("recipe_creation_tag", mealie.db.migration_types.GUID(), nullable=True))
        batch_op.create_foreign_key("fk_groupprefs_tags", "tags", ["recipe_creation_tag"], ["id"])


def downgrade():
    with op.batch_alter_table("group_preferences", schema=None) as batch_op:
        batch_op.drop_constraint("fk_groupprefs_tags", type_="foreignkey")
        batch_op.drop_column("recipe_creation_tag")
```
