# Non-Code Contributions

We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer
- Help translate to a new language or improve current translations

[Remember to join the Discord and stay in touch with other developers working on the project](https://discord.gg/QuStdQGSGK){:target="_blank"}! 

Additionally, you can buy me a coffee and support the project. When I get financial support it helps me know that there's real interest in the project and that it's worth the time to keep developing.
